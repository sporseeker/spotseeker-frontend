            <h2>Ticket Purchase and Payments Policy</h2>
            <h3>Non-Refundable Tickets</h3>
            <p>
              Tickets purchased on the Website are non-refundable except under
              the specific circumstances outlined in the Refunds Policy.
            </p>
            <h3>Non-Exchangeable Tickets</h3>
            <p>
              Tickets cannot be exchanged except under the limited circumstances
              specified in the Refunds Policy.
            </p>
            <h3>Transfer Restrictions</h3>
            <p>
              Tickets may not be transferred to third parties, except to
              immediate family members or friends of the Customer, and under no
              circumstances can they be resold for a price higher than the
              original purchase price. Any attempt to resell Tickets for
              commercial gain will result in cancellation of the Ticket without
              refund, and the Ticket will be deemed invalid for entry.
            </p>
            <h3>Purchase Through Authorized Channels</h3>
            <p>
              Customers are advised to avoid purchasing Spotseeker-branded
              tickets through secondary ticketing websites, as these tickets may
              not be valid for entry or could be canceled by Spotseeker.lk.
            </p>
            <h3>Proof of Purchase</h3>
            <p>
              Spotseeker.lk may require Customers to provide proof of purchase
              upon entry to the event. Acceptable forms of identification
              include an original photo ID (passport, driver&apos;s license,
              national ID card) and/or the original credit/debit card used to
              purchase the tickets. If multiple tickets are purchased, all
              attendees must enter the event together with the Customer.
            </p>
            <h3>Responsibility for Ticket Safety</h3>
            <p>
              Customers are responsible for protecting their tickets from loss
              or theft. Spotseeker.lk does not replace lost or stolen tickets
              for such occurrences. This applies to both physical and electronic
              tickets. If a ticket is stolen or copied and used before the
              Customer arrives at the event, entry will be denied without
              refund.
            </p>
            <h3>Payment and Ticket Delivery</h3>
            <p>
              Payment for tickets is typically required in full at the time of
              purchase. Upon successful payment, the e-ticket will be issued and
              can be accessed via a QR code displayed on the screen or sent to
              the Customer&apos;s registered email. Customers can also download
              the e-ticket from the &quot;My Bookings&quot; section of the
              website.
            </p>
            <h3>Fraudulent Payments</h3>
            <p>
              If a ticket is purchased fraudulently, such as using a stolen
              credit/debit card, Spotseeker.lk reserves the right to cancel the
              ticket without refund.
            </p>

              entry restrictions (e.g., age or dress code) before purchasing

              provide refunds, if entry is declined due to such restrictions or
              any other reason determined by the Organizer.
            </p>
            <h3>Right to Refuse Entry</h3>

              from the event.

              restrictions, or any behavior deemed dangerous, disruptive, or

              Rules and Regulations before purchasing a Ticket.
            </p>
            <h3>Right to Refuse Entry</h3>

              The Organizer and venue management reserve the right to refuse
              admission and conduct security searches to ensure the safety and
              security of the Event at any time.
            </p>
            <h3>No Re-entry Policy</h3>
            <p>
              Many venues enforce a strict “no re-entry” policy. If the Customer
              leaves the venue during the Event, re-entry may not be permitted
              using the original Ticket. Customers are responsible for
              familiarizing themselves with the re-entry policy of the specific
              Event.
            </p>
            <h3>Prohibited Items</h3>
            <p>
              The Organizer or venue management may restrict items allowed into
              the Event, including but not limited to food, beverages, cameras,
              video/audio recording devices, seating, selfie sticks, and items
              considered unlawful, hazardous, or dangerous. Customers are
              encouraged to check these restrictions before attending.
            </p>
            <h3>Liability for Lost Items or Injuries</h3>

              Spotseeker.lk, the Organizer, and venue management accept no
              liability for lost or stolen items or for any injury incurred at
              the Event.
            </p>
            <h3>Photographic and Recording Equipment</h3>
            <p>
              The use of unauthorized photographic and recording equipment may
              be prohibited at the Event. It is the Customer&apos;s
              responsibility to check with the Organizer and venue about any
              restrictions prior to attending the Event.
            </p>
            <h3>Ticket Transferability</h3>
            <p>
              Tickets are for personal use and may only be transferred to
              immediate family members or friends. Tickets cannot be resold at a
              price higher than their original purchase value. Spotseeker.lk
              reserves the right to cancel any ticket that is resold for profit,
              without providing a refund.

              It is the responsibility of the Customer to attend the Event on
              time. Late arrivals may be refused entry by the Organizer or venue
              management, with no entitlement to a refund.
            </p>
            <h3>Last Admission Time</h3>
            <p>
              Many events have a designated “last admission” time, which is
              earlier than the event&apos;s end time. It is the Customer&apos;s
              responsibility to ensure they arrive before this last admission
              time, as late entry may be refused.
            </p>
            <h3>Ejection from the Event</h3>
            <p>
              If a customer is ejected from the Event for any reason by the
              Organizer, its agents, or venue security, they will not be
              entitled to a refund under any circumstances.
            </p>
            <h3>Consent to Being Recorded</h3>
            <p>
              By purchasing a Ticket through Spotseeker.lk, the Customer agrees
              to be photographed, filmed, or recorded by the Organizer, venue
              management, or any third party acting on their behalf at the Event
              or its surroundings. Furthermore, the Customer waives any rights
              to the use of such photographs, videos, or audio recordings
              (“Recorded Material”), allowing the Organizer, venue management,
              or any third party to use them without restriction or recompense.

              </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Refund Request Process</h3>

              Customers must apply for refunds directly to the event organizer
              in writing in the event of cancellation. Spotseeker.lk is not
              responsible for handling or processing refunds.
